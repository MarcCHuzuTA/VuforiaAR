This sample app illustrates how to use the Vuforia UserDefinedTargets feature. This app doesn’t require a predefined image target in order to view the augmentation.  
Instead, the user can define the image that they want to use as a target for the augmented 3D teapot.

To use this app:
1. Point your device at an image such as a poster, magazine page, packaging, etc.
2. Follow the instructions for capturing an image
3. See the teapot augmented on top of your image
